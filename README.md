# Pythonic Physics Engine

## Brief Description
A 2D physics engine made with python, PyGame, and my PyGame wrapper.
It is not designed with best performance in mind.

Needs some better algorithms to avoid n^2 in the big O notation.

## Features
* Deterministic.
* Rotation and torque.
* Gravity.
* Square, line, triangle, and circle collision resolution.
* Poor performance. ;p


# To Do:
- [] Render integration
- [] Gravity
- [] Collision Detection
- [] Collision Resolution
- [] Rotation/Torque calculations




# Please send help.
